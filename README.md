Ringo is a wrapper written in Go around [`biscuit`](https://github.com/dcoker/biscuit).

It can be used to select and decrypt the secrets in your project.

## Usage

Just run `ringo` and it will look for a `config/secrets.yml` file in you current directory.

Type `/` to search and filter the found secrets!
